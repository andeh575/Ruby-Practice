# Stats about myself

myWeight = 190 	# Pounds
myEyes = 'Brown'

# A brief blurb about my stats
puts "Let's talk about #{myName}."
puts "He's #{myHeight} inches tall."
puts "He's #{myWeight} pounds heavy."
puts "Actually... that isn't so heavy."
puts "He's got #{myEyes} eyes, #{myHair} hair, and #{myTeeth} teeth."

# An odd calculation of my stats
puts "If I add #{myAge}, #{myHeight}, and #{myWeight} I get #{myAge + myHeight + myWeight}."
